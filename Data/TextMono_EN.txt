\rHello, we (developers) promise to keep developing this game after launch for months or years to come. Telling your friends about Shortest Trip is your best way to fuel this development.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that Shortest Trip is a very detailed game and was designed to be played on bigger screens (23" monitor with full HD or better). This means that playing with a big screen ensures a very nice experience (everything has enough space on the screen) while playing on a small screen makes everything more difficult and stressful.\r\n\r\nWe've been working on Shortes Trip daily for many good years with a small and dedicated team. Your support is what drives us.\r\n\r\nThank you for existing,\r\ndevelopers of Shortest Trip\r
